# SSM
This repository contains synthesizable VHDL descriptions and testbenches for the static segmented multipliers (SSMs) described in our paper:

# Folders in the Repository
* unsigned : contains VHDL code for static segmented multipliers with and without error correction
* signed : containd two subfolders:
   * proposed_segmentation : VHDL code for signed SSMs using the segmentation proposed in our work, with and without error correction.
   * modulus_sign_corrected: VHDL code for signed SSMs obtained by transforming the operands in sign-modulus representation, multiplying the modules of the operand with an unsigned SSM and transforming the results in 2â€™s complements representation.
